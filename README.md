### Smidyo Object Types

These are Typescript types and generated JSON schemas for Smidyo pipeline bodies and table bodies.

You can `npm install @smidyo/smidyo-object-types` these if you want to use them in your operation blocks or element blocks.

# Generated docs

You can see generated docs for the pipelines in /generated-docs, however they are not very good. The JSDoc comments in the Typescript may be easier to read.
